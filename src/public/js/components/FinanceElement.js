/*
    In this component, there are several usages of dangerouslySetInnerHTML.

    In the context of the public dataviz project, the strings being used are HTML generated by 
    a markdown parser+renderer. This part is considered trusted enough.

    The content being passed to the markdown parser is created and reviewed by the project team and likely
    by the communication team at the DÃ©partement de la Gironde. So this content is very very unlikely to ever
    contain anything that could cause any harm.

    For these reasons, the usages of dangerouslySetInnerHTML are fine.
